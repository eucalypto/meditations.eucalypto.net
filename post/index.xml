      <description>I love astronomy and the universe. I also love analogies between distant topics.
For this analogy I have to tell you one thing about stars which are just suns. They differ by size/mass and it determines most properties of a sun. In particular: the larger the size/mass, the brighter the sun shines, the hotter it is, and the shorter it lives!
Often, I observe the same with motivation and people. The hotter they burn for something, the stronger their motivation.</description>

      <description>Goodread Challenge If you are on Goodreads, you may have received a notification for the 2021 Goodreads Reading Challenge. There you can set your goal for how many books you want to read this year.
But is the number of read books a good measure?
I&amp;rsquo;m reminded of Goodhart&amp;rsquo;s Law here:
 When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.
 How to become better at book-reading?</description>
