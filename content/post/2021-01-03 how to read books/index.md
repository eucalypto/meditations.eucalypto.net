## Goodread Challenge

If you are on Goodreads, you may have received a notification for the _2021 Goodreads Reading Challenge_. There you can set your goal for how many books you want to read this year.

But is the number of read books a good measure?

I'm reminded of [Goodhart's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Goodhart%27s_law) here:

> When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.

## How to become better at book-reading?

If you read books for pleasure, you may ignore everything here. But then you would also not care about how much books you read.

For me, book reading is important and consequently, I want to achieve a certain level of professionalism. This includes both book selection and actual reading.

- How do I know which book will bring me the most benefits?
- How do I measure the benefits _after_ I have read a book?

Let's take a step back. What we _can_ say is this: if you have read a book and _nothing_ did change, the book was ineffective.

### What can change?

I see two areas where change is possible:

1) Action
2) Mindset

Action is what you and others see you do. The Mindset is trickier to see but it still shows in subtle ways.

So if neither your actions, nor your mindset have changed, then we may argue that the book is useless.

### How to make sure something does change?

Now this is a good question! We have to make more experiments and meditations about this!
