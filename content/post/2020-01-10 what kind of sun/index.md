I love astronomy and the universe. I also love analogies between distant topics.

For this analogy I have to tell you one thing about stars which are just suns. They differ by _size/mass_ and it determines most properties of a sun. In particular: the larger the size/mass, the brighter the sun shines, the hotter it is, and the **shorter** it lives!

Often, I observe the same with motivation and people. The hotter they burn for something, the stronger their motivation. But this motivation is then often fragile: when it runs cold, trouble awaits. Before that happens, people say phrases like "keep the momentum rolling", or "let's use that energy".

Blue giant is an example of a large but short lived star, whereas a Red Dwarf would be a small but long-lived one. When a blue giant reaches the end of its lifetime, it explodes in a supernova, but I think this is where the analogy starts to break down.

Maybe a better analogy would be surfing (wave riding). Or: surfing the shockwave of a supernova! But that's enough analogies for one day. :)

The question in the title is misleading and implies false assumptions. It implies that one person behaves consistently in a certain way. But I observed myself behaving in both ways!

Hot, passionate motivation is hard to manage for me. I'm full of energy but have to pay close attention to direct it in a productive direction. It's easy to get lost in details and let the energy go to waste. And after it is gone, I'm regularly confused as to where to go next.

The slow-burning kind of motivation is a lot easier to handle. I feel in control all the time and have mental capacity to look for the direction for the next milestone.

**But there are many questions left**

Is one of those kinds superior to the other?

Can I reliably create the hot one? It seems to come randomly.

What is the right mix of those two to have a good life?
