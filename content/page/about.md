These are the thoughts (a.k.a. meditations) of me, Eucalypto. The title is a reference to Meditations by Marcus Aurelius.

These thoughts are here because I want to practice putting them into words. Like Marcus Aurelius, I'm not expecting them to reach a lot of people.

And this is where the analogy stops being accurate. :)
