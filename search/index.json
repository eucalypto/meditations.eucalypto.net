[{"content":"I love astronomy and the universe. I also love analogies between distant topics.\nFor this analogy I have to tell you one thing about stars which are just suns. They differ by size/mass and it determines most properties of a sun. In particular: the larger the size/mass, the brighter the sun shines, the hotter it is, and the shorter it lives!\nOften, I observe the same with motivation and people. The hotter they burn for something, the stronger their motivation. But this motivation is then often fragile: when it runs cold, trouble awaits. Before that happens, people say phrases like \u0026ldquo;keep the momentum rolling\u0026rdquo;, or \u0026ldquo;let\u0026rsquo;s use that energy\u0026rdquo;.\nBlue giant is an example of a large but short lived star, whereas a Red Dwarf would be a small but long-lived one. When a blue giant reaches the end of its lifetime, it explodes in a supernova, but I think this is where the analogy starts to break down.\nMaybe a better analogy would be surfing (wave riding). Or: surfing the shockwave of a supernova! But that\u0026rsquo;s enough analogies for one day. :)\nThe question in the title is misleading and implies false assumptions. It implies that one person behaves consistently in a certain way. But I observed myself behaving in both ways!\nHot, passionate motivation is hard to manage for me. I\u0026rsquo;m full of energy but have to pay close attention to direct it in a productive direction. It\u0026rsquo;s easy to get lost in details and let the energy go to waste. And after it is gone, I\u0026rsquo;m regularly confused as to where to go next.\nThe slow-burning kind of motivation is a lot easier to handle. I feel in control all the time and have mental capacity to look for the direction for the next milestone.\nBut there are many questions left\nIs one of those kinds superior to the other?\nCan I reliably create the hot one? It seems to come randomly.\nWhat is the right mix of those two to have a good life?\n","date":"2021-01-10T17:41:27+01:00","image":"https://meditations.eucalypto.net/p/what-kind-of-sun-are-you/pexels-felix-mittermeier-956981_hu3d03a01dcc18bc5be0e67db3d8d209a6_875916_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://meditations.eucalypto.net/p/what-kind-of-sun-are-you/","title":"What Kind of Sun are You?"},{"content":"Goodread Challenge If you are on Goodreads, you may have received a notification for the 2021 Goodreads Reading Challenge. There you can set your goal for how many books you want to read this year.\nBut is the number of read books a good measure?\nI\u0026rsquo;m reminded of Goodhart\u0026rsquo;s Law here:\n When a measure becomes a target, it ceases to be a good measure.\n How to become better at book-reading? If you read books for pleasure, you may ignore everything here. But then you would also not care about how much books you read.\nFor me, book reading is important and consequently, I want to achieve a certain level of professionalism. This includes both book selection and actual reading.\n How do I know which book will bring me the most benefits? How do I measure the benefits after I have read a book?  Let\u0026rsquo;s take a step back. What we can say is this: if you have read a book and nothing did change, the book was ineffective.\nWhat can change? I see two areas where change is possible:\n Action Mindset  Action is what you and others see you do. The Mindset is trickier to see but it still shows in subtle ways.\nSo if neither your actions, nor your mindset have changed, then we may argue that the book is useless.\nHow to make sure something does change? Now this is a good question! We have to make more experiments and meditations about this!\n","date":"2021-01-03T23:28:45+01:00","image":"https://meditations.eucalypto.net/p/how-to-read-books/pexels-polina-zimmerman-3747507_hu9ea89b7dc2b068e1510124d61a7ffea4_404810_120x120_fill_q75_box_smart1.jpg","permalink":"https://meditations.eucalypto.net/p/how-to-read-books/","title":"How to read Books"}]
